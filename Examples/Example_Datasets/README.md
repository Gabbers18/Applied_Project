# File Descriptions

## [MEA_video16.txt](https://github.com/Gabbers18/Applied_Project/blob/main/Examples/Example_Datasets/MEA_video16.txt)

This file contains 18016 rows. Each row represents a single video frame. The values in the rows represent motion energy which is calculated by extracting frame-by-frame differences in individual participation movements.

For this example, I chose to examine Dyad 16 participant data.

- .txt file
- Direct output from [Ramseyer's MEA software](https://psync.ch/mea/)
- Particiant identity is determined by pretenses set in MEA (ROIs - regions of interest) 
- Column 1 is participant 2
- Column 2 is participant 1

## [dyad_16_MEA.csv](https://github.com/Gabbers18/Applied_Project/blob/main/Examples/Example_Datasets/dyad_16_MEA.csv)

This file contains the same information as MEA_video16.txt file, but in .csv format. 

- .csv file
- Column 1 is Participant 2's timeseries data
- Column 2 is participant 1's timeseries data
