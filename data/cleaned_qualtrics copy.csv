From our shelter, we need to map out where the mining camp is as well as any mountains. This may also be a good time to study what plants are edible in the area (we should only hunt animals after we can't find any plants since they will likely take far more effort). From here, if we can spot any mountains in the direction of the camp, we need to hike toward them (morning or night, preferably) in order to gain a better vantage point and hopefully use the mirror to signal any passing vehicles or planes.

The plan that I envision would involve us acknowledging that we have to conserve the bottled water and leave that under a shade so that the plastic doesn't come into direct sunlight, thus creating the water to be bad for us. 

The immediate plan that I would have would be to look at the map and see more or less where we are positioned with the compass, and see if the truly closest area is 70 miles away. With the gun, I'm not really sure what we would use it for but we would have to keep it around just in case.

The materials that are present I believe are now listed in the correct order of importance, the reason I feel that they have been listed in importance is because they offer immediate aid, the sunglasses shield our eyes from the sun, and the flashlight allows us to see the oncoming threats at night.
